    "Title": "Germs : Biological Weapons and America's Secret War",
    "Authors": "By Miller, Judith, Engelberg, Stephen, and Broad, William J.",
    "Description": "Deadly germs sprayed in shopping malls, bomb-lets spewing anthrax spores over battlefields, tiny vials of plague scattered in Times Square -- these are the poor man's hydrogen bombs, hideous weapons of mass destruction that can be made in a simple laboratory. In this groundbreaking work of investigative journalism, Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg, and William Broad of The New York Times uncover the truth about biological weapons and show why bio-warfare and bio-terrorism are fast becoming our worst national nightmare.  Among the startling revelations in Germs:   How the CIA secretly built and tested a model of a Soviet-designed germ bomb, alarming some officials who felt the work pushed to the limits of what is permitted by the global treaty banning germ arms. How the Pentagon embarked on a secret effort to make a superbug. Details about the Soviet Union's massive hidden program to produce biological weapons, including new charges that germs were tested on humans. How Moscow's scientists made an untraceable germ that instructs the body to destroy itself. The Pentagon's chaotic efforts to improvise defenses against Iraq's biological weapons during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. How a religious cult in Oregon in the 1980s sickened hundreds of Americans in a bio-terrorism attack that the government played down to avoid panic and copycat strikes. Plans by the U.S. military in the 1960s to attack Cuba with germ weapons.   Germs also shows how a small group of scientists and senior officials persuaded President Bill Clinton to launch a controversial multibillion-dollar program to detect a germ attack on U.S. soil and to aid its victims -- a program that, so far, is struggling to provide real protection.  Based on hundreds of interviews with scientists and senior officials, including President Clinton, as well as on recently declassified documents and on-site reporting from the former Soviet Union's sinister bio-weapons labs, Germs shows us bio-warriors past and present at wo",

It is the story of Bragg's father, a hard-drinking man with a murderous temper and the habit of running out on the people who needed him most.But at the center of this soaring memoir is Bragg's mother, who went eighteen years without a new dress so that her sons could have school clothes and picked other people's cotton so that her children wouldn't have to live on welfare alone. Evoking these lives--and the country that shaped and nourished them--with artistry, honesty, and compassion, Rick Bragg brings home the love and suffering that lie at the heart of every family. The result is unforgettable.",

    "Title": "Hill Rat: Blowing the Lid Off Congress",
    "Authors": "By Jackley, John L.",
    "Description": "As a top aide to powerful Texas Congressman Ronald Coleman, John Jackley watched the nation's highest elected officials lie, manipulate media images, and spend millions of taxpayer dollars to stay in power. The mind-boggling scope of the abuse of perks and privilege by both legislators and their staffers finally shocked him into reality.What began as a secret journal for his children to clear his conscience has become Hill Rat, a journey behind Congress' closed doors and into the corrupt back alleys of power. With both humor and outrage, Jackley reveals how the promise of Congress has been hijacked and corrupted by the current crop of careerist incumbents. \"Today,\" he writes, \"a successful congressman has the fundraising ability of a hooker trying to make cab fare home and the morals of a big-time football coach!\"His account is laced with the names of Capitol Hill's most prominent legislators--Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, Speaker of the House Thomas Foley, Ron Dellums, Bill Alexander, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, Thomas Luken, and scores of others. Jackley also reveals, with names, dates, and examples, the outrageous power of Congressional staffers--\"Hill Rats\"--who \"run the engines of democracy on a daily basis and pride themselves on their ability to do anything in the name of their cause.\"To show the flagrant abuse of taxpayers' money for re-election purposes, Jackley points out that in just forty-eight hours in early 1992, the House mailed more than 58 million newsletters and postcards. In 1990, the first post-Jim Wright, post-congressional scandal election, 96% of the incumbents who ran were reelected. Even in 1988, only six Members running for re-election were defeated, a turnover rate less than that of the Soviet Politburo.From previously untold Congressional involvement in Oliver North's contra re-supply network to Democratic complicity in the S&L crisis to the taxpayer-funded incumbent protection plan, Hill Rat reveals secrets backed by hard evidence t",

    "Description": "It was a wonderful summer, a great memory, the kind of love everybody ought to have. It changed my life - or almost did - and I think about it more than I should, but that was a long time ago.Amid the breathtaking beauty of the Catskill Mountains, Avrum Feldman listened to the haunting voice of Amelita Galli-Curci ringing over the Shandaken Valley - a voice no one else could hear. When he died at age one hundred six, his obsession for the famous opera diva had lasted three-quarters of a century. Most people considered Avrum crazy, someone preoccupied with romantic nonsense. But Madison Lee \"Bobo\" Murphy was not among them, for he, too, had a love that changed his life, or almost did: Amy Lourie.In the summer of 1955, Bobo was a waiter at the Catskill's Pine Hill Inn; a rural Southerner who had never heard the word meshugge until Avrum - a retired furrier, teacher, and translator from New York City - became his unlikely friend. For Bobo nothing about that summer ever lost its glow: his first taste of kartoffel suppe; the exotic mingling of Yiddish and German in the dining room; the girl he met and loved....In everyone's life, Avrum had instructed, there is one grand, undeniable moment of change that never stops mattering. It came for Bobo in his first meeting with Amy, the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. He was too naive to comprehend the gulf between their worlds, and she was too smitten by him to care. But for a wealthy Jewish girl and a Georgia farm boy, the summer had to end, leaving Bobo to learn the painful lesson of loving someone and believing you cannot be with them.Now, thirty-eight years later, Avrum is gone, leaving a will that beckons Bobo north to the Catskills once more. In the places he'd walked so often on the paths of memory, he embraces the ghosts of old friendships and the haunting hints of Amy's presence, until she unexpectedly appears. Nothing has dimmed the passion of their youth, yet two lifetimes and a thousand Catskills sunsets stand b",

    "Authors": "By Haufler, Hervie",
    "Description": "For the first time ever, veteran World War II cryptographer Hervie Haufler details how American and British codebreakers were the decisive factor in the Allied victory. From the Purple Machine to the Navajo Talkers to the breaking of Japan's JN-25 Naval Code to the shadowy world of decoding units like Hut-8 in Bletchley Park, he shows how crucial information-often obtained by surreptitious and violent means-was the decisive edge in the Battle of Britain, at Midway and against the U-Boats in the North Atlantic, and how Allied intelligence saved the Soviet Union from almost certain defeat.  In an accessible account based on years of research, interviews and exclusive access to previously top-secret archives, Haufler demonstrates how cryptography enabled Nimitz and MacArthur to persevere in the Pacific and helped Eisenhower and Patton mount the assaults on Normandy. In compelling detail, Haufler shows us how it was done-as only one who was on the frontlines of the \"secret war\" could tell it.",

    "Description": "From the author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People comes an inspiring new bestseller that puts human feelings of guilt and inadequacy in perspective - and teaches us how we can learn to accept ourselves and others even when we and they are less than perfect. How Good Do We Have to Be? is for everyone who experiences that sense of guilt and disappointment. Harold Kushner, writing with his customary generosity and wisdom, shows us how human life is too complex for anyone to live it without making mistakes, and why we need not fear the loss of God's love when we are less than perfect. Harold Kushner begins by offering a radically new interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve, which he sees as a tale of Paradise Outgrown rather than Paradise Lost: eating from the Tree of Knowledge was not an act of disobedience, but a brave step forward toward becoming human, complete with the richness of work, sexuality and child-rearing, and a sense of our mortality. Drawing on modern literature, psychology, theology,,and his own thirty years of experience as a congregational rabbi, Harold Kushner reveals how acceptance and forgiveness can change our relationships with the most important people in our lives and help us meet the bold and rewarding challenge of being human.",

    "Authors": "By Goldman, Kevin",
    "Description": "On December 16, 1994, a bloodletting took place in the stylish sixth-floor boardroom at Saatchi & Saatchi Company PLC, once the world's largest advertising agency holding company. Maurice Saatchi, the 48 year-old chairman who co-founded the company in 1970 with his older brother Charles, was fired by the board of directors under threat by the firm's largest shareholders. Less than a month later, Maurice started a rival ad agency and quickly snapped up former Saatchi & Saatchi clients, most importantly British Airways. Kevin Goldman, the former daily advertising columnist for the Wall Street Journal, spoke to everyone connected with this headline-making saga -- including Maurice Saatchi and his reclusive brother Charles -- and witnessed important business meetings, including Maurice Saatchi's winning pitch to British Airways. Goldman traces every step the Saatchi brothers took, from their youth as Iraqi Jewish immigrants in North London to their business merger in 1970, when, with little more than sheer audacity, the opened an ad agency with a full-page announcement ad in the London Sunday Times. Through bold and brash actions, the agency began an acquisitions binge, taking over many of the ad industry's giants -- including Ted Bates, Backer & Spielvogel, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, and Garland-Compton -- to become the number one ad company in the world. But, once they acquired a company, the brothers lost interest, often refusing to meet with its executives again. This disdain would come back to haunt them. Also chronicled is the brothers' rich lifestyle, which critics claim was funded by the company. This tale features a rich cast of supporting players: Jeremy Sinclair, a creative advertising genius who was fiercely loyal to the brothers, was one of the executives who resigned after Maurice was fired. Bill Muirhead, another loyalist, was responsible for keeping clients happy. Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a globe-trotting native of France, was brought in by the Saatchis in 1",

    "Authors": "By Moore, Geoffrey A.",
    "Description": "\"The chasm is where high-tech fortunes are lost... the tornado is where they are made.\"-- Steve Jobs, Founder & CEO, Next Computer, Inc.    Now, in this fascinating sequel, Moore shows how to capitalize on the profit-rich niches and hyper-growth markets beyond the chasm. Continuing to chart the impact of the Technology Adoption Life Cycle, he explores its effects not just on marketing but on overall business planning, especially strategic partnerships, competitive advantage, positioning and organizational leadership. Moore's most startling lesson is: \"As markets move from stage to stage in the Life Cycle, the winning strategy does not just change -- it actually reverses the prior strategy. The very skills that you've just perfected become your biggest liabilities; and if you can't put them aside to acquire new ones, then you're in for tough times.\" As challenging as this lesson is to apply, Moore leads the way. Using actual examples of cutting-edge firms, he applies the Life Cycle model to all aspects of managing a market-focused business strategy, including how to manage people effectively through each phase of the cycle. There are significant management implications: Chasm-crossers who love the customer intimacy of niches may rebel against the depersonalizing power of the tornado; tornado managers who relish the gales of hyper-growth may resist the inevitable return to the niche, in the guise of mass customization, once the rush to the new paradigm subsides. All industries relying on technology -- not just computer hardware, software and telecommunications, but entertainment, publishing, broadcasting, banking, insurance, health care, aerospace, defense, utilities, pharmaceuticals and retail -- must master Moore's lessons to see the year 2000. If you are marketing technology-based products or managing the people who do, then you will find yourself Inside the Tornado.",

    "Title": "Sherlock Holmes and the Red Demon by John H. Watson, M.D.",
    "Authors": "By Watson, John H. and Millett, Larry (EDT)",
    "Description": "It is the story of how the world's most beloved private detective, Sherlock Holmes, and Watson traveled to Minnesota in 1894 to find and stop a murderous arsonist, known only as the Red Demon, who is threatening both Hill and his Great Northern Railway. Homes's pursuit of this malignant and cunning villain presents the great man \"with the most remarkable case of his celebrated career.\"In Minnesota, Holmes comes face-to-face with all manner of frontier characters, including two-fisted railroad men, rough-and-tumble lumberjacks, a one-eyed teamster, and an unsavory town marshal. But he also encounters the proprietress of the North Woods' most opulent sporting house, Mary Robinson, a woman as clever as she is beautiful. In response to a churlish remark from Dr. Watson about the morality of her establishment, she replies: \"Morality is a matter of power, nothing more and nothing less. The rich impose it on the poor, men impose it on women, and the forces of reaction impose it upon those who seek a better world.\"Needless to say, Holmes becomes especially attentive to this suspect's articulate charm. But charm gives way to terror in the exciting climax of the tale, a chase on the rails that ends with Holmes and the Red Demon squared off on a lonely bridge in a fiery circle of death. \"Never,\" says Watson, \"was Holmes more magnificent than at that moment.\"",

There, he becomes a fan of a G.I. stationed at the base, one Elvis Presley, whose music is played over and over on the radio. When Orson is caught stealing recordings of Elvis's tunes from the PX, the attendant publicity catches the star's attention, and he comes to visit his young fan. Thus begins a lifelong friendship. As Elvis's career rockets ever higher and his behavior becomes ever more erratic, the two share many adventures. The sixties explode, and Elvis becomes the icon of the nation, while Orson, a college demonstrator, drifts away from regular life while looking for something of substance to believe in. Each man is an emblem of his time, as social conventions crumble, barriers fall, and the cultural landscape changes forever.A panorama of change and dissent, of the ability of friends to stay true despite distance and time, Elvis in the Morning portrays a nation in change and the effects of celebrity on innocence.",

Halliday takes readers deep into Jefferson's private life—exploring his childhood, his literary taste, and his unconventional religious thinking and moral philosophy. Here, too, are his adamant opinions on women, the evolution of his ideas on democracy and freedom of expression, and fresh insights into his relationship with Sally Hemings.",

    "Description": "Last spring Billy Bean, the only living openly gay former major leaguer, gained national attention with his breakthrough memoir, Going the Other Way?an unprecedented chronicle of America’s national pastime that went on to sell more than 25,000 copies. Bean brings us inside the clubhouse and onto the playing field, offering dead-on insight into the game and the physical and emotional demands it makes on players. Bean faced an agonizing choice, in secrecy and solitude, between continuing to play the game he loved and the honesty of a loving relationship. By turns heartbreaking and farcical, ruminative and uncensored, the book culminates in a respectful, deeply felt appeal to Major League Baseball and other professional team sports to live up to their promise of equality and opportunity. A testament to the power of the single voice, Going the Other Way is an exemplary American tale that points the way toward a more perfect game, one in which all men and women can pursue their athletic dreams free of prejudice and discrimination.

Where his first,Burnt Water, published in 1980, had as its underlying theme Mexico City itself,Constancia and Other Stories for Virgins extends its imaginative boundaries out to Savannah, to Cadiz, to Glasgow, to Seville and Madrid, both past and present. This new collection is more mysterious, more magical, too, than its predecessor, and in its five related stories Fuentes comes closer to the registers of language and feeling that he explored so memorably inAura. It reveals Fuentes at the height of his powers--bold, erudite, enthralling.In the title story, a man discovers his wife's secret complicity with the Russian actor who is their neighbor--a complicity that includes not just a previous life but possibly a previous death as well. He finds himself \"a mediator . . . a point between one sorrow and the next, between one hope and the next, between two languages, two memories, two ages, and two deaths.\" In \"La Desdichada,\" two students steal--and fall in love with--a store-window mannequin. In \"The Prisoner of Las Lomas,\" a wealthy lawyer in possession of a powerful secret is held hostage by the past he has attempted to subvert and keep at bay. The celebrated bullfighter whose fame is the theme of \"Viva Mi Fama\" steps from the present into a past immortalized by Goya's portrait of the matador Pedro Romero; and the architects who are the \"Reasonable People\" of that story find themselves drawn into the irrational mysteries not only of religious fervor but of their famous mentor's identity--they discover \"there are no empty houses,\" only a present fraught with the past.Though each of these novella-length stories offers compelling evidence of Fuentes's talent for narrative free rein as well as for containment and closure, they are also brilliantly interwoven.

    "Title": "Global Literacies: Lessons on Business Leadership and National Cultures",
    "Authors": "By Rosen, Robert (EDT), Digh, Patricia, Singer, Marshall, and Phillips, Carl",
    "Description": "Throughout the world, languages differ, but the business questions are the same. In French and Japanese, Hebrew and English, executives are asking, \"How can I survive and thrive in the borderless, global marketplace?\"  For answers, the authors of Global Literacies went straight to the leaders themselves -- the CEOs of thousands of corporations around the globe.  Two lessons emerged. First, there are leadership universals that every executive and manager needs to practice in order to be world-class at home and abroad. The second defied conventional wisdom: in the borderless economy, culture doesn't matter less, it matters more.  Around the world, business leaders apply their own experiences -- personal, professional, and cultural -- to an ever-expanding world of Dutch colleagues, Brazilian suppliers, Taiwanese manufacturers, and Chinese competitors. These leaders are trying to become globally literate...and Global Literacies is for, and about, them.  No one knows this better than CEOs of successful global companies such as Japan's Canon, Sweden's Ericsson, Taiwan's Acer Computers, the U.K.'s British Telecommunications, and U.S.-based Coca-Cola.

    "Title": "I Wish I Had a Red Dress",
    "Authors": "By Cleage, Pearl",
    "Description": "Joyce Mitchell was widowed far too young when her beloved husband, Mitch, died in a tragic accident five years ago. Since then she's kept her hands full and her mind and heart occupied by running The Sewing Circus, an all-girl group she founded to provide badly needed services like day care and job counseling to young women, many of whom are single mothers. More important, The Circus is a place for lively, wide-ranging, heart-to-heart discussions that will help members grow into what Joyce likes to call \"twenty-first-century free women.\"All in all, Joyce has a full and rich life. She has her work, her family, her friends, and her town. But there are some nights when she crawls into bed alone and has to admit that something is missing. What she doesn't have is that red dress she keeps dreaming about or a social life that would accommodate it even if she braved the mail and bought one. To further complicate matters, she may not have The Sewing Circus much longer, as the state legislature has decided not to fund the group's vital but hard-todefine work with young women who are too often regarded as problems rather than possibilities.Feeling defeated and pessimistic, Joyce reluctantly agrees to keep a date for dinner at the home of her best friend, Sister -- a reverend like no other-and finds not only a perfect meal but a tall, dark stranger named Nate Anderson. Nate has just joined the administration at the high school and his unexpected presence in Idlewild touches a chord in Joyce that she thought her heart had forgotten how to play. Nate feels the same immediate connection, but both have enough experience with broken hearts to take it real slow. Besides, they've got too much work to do to concentrate on falling in love....But life moves at its own pace, and as Sister says, \"if you want to make God laugh, make plans.\" Particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. Joyce decides the trick is to stay focused and to remember that nothing is as sexy as the truth, th",

    "Title": "Chinese Roundabout: Essays in History and Culture",
    "Authors": "By Spence, Jonathan D.",
    "Description": "The spirit of adventure is at the heart of Jonathan Spence's widely acclaimed scholarship on the modern history of China. This vitality, fleshed out with deep research and attired in elegant style, has drawn countless readers to subjects otherwise approachable only by experts. Through eight books, from the story of the early eighteenth century Manchu bondservant Ts'ao Yin to his magisterial history, The Search for Modern China, Spence has made the excitement of intellectual discovery palpable for us all. In the course of his fruitful career Spence has written many shorter pieces as well, and the best of these are collected for the first time in Chinese Roundabout. Here the reader will meet Arcadio Huang, the Chinese linguist and Christian convert who moves from south China to Enlightenment Paris, marries a French woman, and in conversations with Montesquieu becomes the likely source for the Persian Letters. The poignant story of Huang's hard-won success and final defeat by poverty and disease illustrates the perils of crossing cultures. Spence's delight in intellectual risk animates his Shakespearean approach to the life of the great Qing emperor in \"The Seven Ages of K'ang-hsi.\" Spence's great learning informs an authoritative essay on China's tragic experience with opium. Following the social process of addiction from the cultivation of poppies and the processing of the drug through its introduction by the British into China, its widespread distribution and consumption by Chinese, and the public struggle to suppress opium use, Spence explores issues of historical and contemporary interest. In an equally substantial piece he focuses on the cultural dimensions of food in Qing China, illuminating the marginal diet of a peasantry constantly threatened by famine as well as the grand banquets of the literati and the imperial household. In the work of 25 years, Spence has established himself as a brilliant interpreter of modern Chinese history. His books—among them the",

As Katie Donovan says in her introduction: \"Our selection is intended to give the reader a taste of the varied spectrum, from the courtly praise of men to swinish male chauvinism; from women's declarations of outrage against church and state to their celebrations of childbirth and motherhood.\" This book celebrates the vast range of women's thought and activity, their spirituality, and their passions.The women who appear in this collection are both well known and unknown, real and invented. The editors have drawn freely upon translations of the mythological tales and later Irish poems, upon letters, biographies, and newspapers as well as prose and poetry, plays, recordings and songs, in order to present a complex multilayered and richly rewarding view of Ireland's women.",

    "Description": "Embattled, feeling victimized and entitled, many patients once again seek out help despite previous years of unsuccessful psychotherapy or analysis. Feeling frozen and unable to change and putting up a seemingly impenetrable wall of resistance, such patients are among the most difficult to reach. In this original work, Israeli psychologist Rena Moses-Hrushovski describes her therapeutic endeavors with such patients. She discovered in many such people a specific form of narcissistic character resistance which she terms deployment. Deployment is a vigilant use of the balances of interpersonal power designed to ward off intolerable feelings, predominantly of envy, shame, and guilt. Patients who use deployment put themselves in the role of the victim and then battle against perceived injustice, abuse, and oppression for the right to be understood and accepted. Such patients often expect the therapist to take responsibility for their suffering.In addition to exploring deployment as a kind of self organization, Dr. Moses-Hrushovski details her formulation of treatment approaches that enable her to build bridges to these patients and help them uncover and live with the feeling states that they are desperately trying to ward off.",

From the Menendez brothers to Lorena Bobbitt, more and more Americans accused of violent crimes are admitting to the charges, but arguing that they shouldn't be held legally responsible. The reason: they're victims - of an abusive parent, a violent spouse, a traumatic experience, ethnic hatred, society at large, or anything else - who struck back at a real or perceived oppressor. And they couldn't help themselves, they say.In this provocative and important collection of essays, Dershowitz reviews a wide range of recent cases - including those of O. J. Simpson, Tonya Harding, and Woody Allen - and argues that the current vogue in victim defenses is antithetical to the ideals of our constitutional democracy. For Dershowitz, the foundations of American society are individual responsibility and the rule of law. And people who claim to be above the law - whatever the excuse - are no more than vigilantes.",

    "Title": "Horsewatching: Why does a horse whinny and everything else you ever wanted to know",
    "Authors": "By Morris, Desmond",
    "Description": "How intelligent are horses? Why do they toss their heads and what makes them paw the ground?After spending more than twenty years studying the body language of the human species, Desmond Morris has turned his attention to the behavior of some of our closest animal companions. First he looked at dogs, then cats, and now horses. As Curator of Mammals at the London Zoo he was able to study closely the zebras and wild horse in his charge. More recently, as a racehorse owner, he has scrutinized the glamorous world of thoroughbred racing.Throughout his long involvement with horses, Desmond Morris has never stopped asking questions. InHorsewatching he sets out to answer them. As a zoologist and a lifelong student of animal behavior, he approaches the horse world in an unusual way, dealing with topics often ignored in equine literature. In addition to examining details of behavior, Dr Morris considers such questions as why horseshoes bring good luck, why we don’t eat horses, why jockeys are allowed to whip their mounts and why we call a bad dream a nightmare.And for punters everywhere, he applies his zoological mind to the all-important question of why some horses run faster than others…",

    "Description": "There is a superstition that if an emptied theater is ever left completely dark, a ghost will take up residence. To prevent this, a single \"ghost light\" is left burning at center stage after the audience and all of the actors and musicians have gone home. Frank Rich's eloquent and moving boyhood memoir reveals how theater itself became a ghost light and a beacon of security for a child finding his way in a tumultuous world.Rich grew up in the small-townish Washington, D.C., of the 1950s and early '60s, a place where conformity seemed the key to happiness for a young boy who always felt different. When Rich was seven years old, his parents separated--at a time when divorce was still tantamount to scandal--and thereafter he and his younger sister were labeled \"children from a broken home.\" Bouncing from school to school and increasingly lonely, Rich became terrified of the dark and the uncertainty of his future. But there was one thing in his life that made him sublimely happy: the Broadway theater.Rich's parents were avid theatergoers, and in happier times they would listen to the brand-new recordings of South Pacific, Damn Yankees, and The Pajama Game over and over in their living room. When his mother's remarriage brought about turbulent changes, Rich took refuge in these same records, re-creating the shows in his imagination, scene by scene. He started collecting Playbills, studied fanatically the theater listings in The New York Times and Variety, and cut out ads to create his own miniature marquees. He never imagined that one day he would be the Times's chief theater critic.Eventually Rich found a second home at Wash-ington's National Theatre, where as a teenager he was a ticket-taker and was introduced not only to the backstage magic he had dreamed of for so long but to a real-life cast of charismatic and eccentric players who would become his mentors and friends. With humor and eloquence, Rich tells the triumphant story of how the aspirations of a stagestruck ",

After all, something inside her is telling her to get back to the desert ranch - why else would she be cooking spicy Mexican meatball soup at her cottage in Maine, when clam chowder should be on the menu?But along with the excitement she feels at going home is an inexplicable sense of foreboding, which is tragically realized once she arrives in Tucson. The ranch manager and his granddaughter are missing from Las Palomas and feared dead. A cryptic note written by one of them containing initials and a meeting time is the only clue that leads Mrs. Potter to suspect foul play. But why would anyone want to harm her old friends? And where could they have disappeared to?When a guest at a dinner gathering thrown by Mrs. Potter winds up dead - apparently from eating her own famous 27-ingredient chili - Mrs. Potter knows she must get involved in solving the crimes before the murderer strikes again.In the midst of these disturbing goings-on, an old love from Eugenia's past arrives on the scene to spice up the danger with a bit of romance.

    "Description": "More than twenty years ago, a disillusioned college graduate named Peter Jenkins set out with his dog Cooper to look for himself and his nation.  His memoir of what he found, A Walk Across America, captured the hearts of millions of Americans.Now, Peter is a bit older, married with a family, and his journeys are different than they were. Perhaps he is looking for adventure, perhaps inspiration, perhaps new communities, perhaps unspoiled land.  Certainly, he found all of this and more in Alaska, America's last wilderness.Looking for Alaska is Peter's account of eighteen months spent traveling over twenty thousand miles in tiny bush planes, on snow machines and snowshoes, in fishing boats and kayaks, on the Alaska Marine Highway and the Haul Road, searching for what defines Alaska. Hearing the amazing stories of many real Alaskans--from Barrow to Craig, Seward to Deering, and everywhere in between--Peter gets to know this place in the way that only he can. His resulting portrait is a rare and unforgettable depiction of a dangerous and beautiful land and all the people that call it home.  He also took his wife and eight-year-old daughter with him, settling into a \"home base\" in Seward on the Kenai Peninsula, coming and going from there, and hosting the rest of their family for extended visits. The way his family lived, how they made Alaska their home and even participated in Peter's explorations, is as much a part of this story as Peter's own travels.All in all, Jenkins delivers a warm, funny, awe-inspiring, and memorable diary of discovery-both of this place that captures all of our imaginations, and of himself, all over again.",

At the center of their communal pain is Sadie's intelligent, beautiful, ambitious daughter Story, who wants more from life than she's been led to expect. Her uncompromising desire for \"safety\" corrupts Story to her very soul, dooming her to wander an emotional desert, repressed, rigid, enslaved to propriety. Her daughter Hermine must then challenge the lie that life is hardship. But can Hermine finally break the cycle of oppression that has chained the women of her family? Can she alone cross over Jordan?Reminiscent of the early work of Alice Walker and Gloria Naylor, Crossing Over Jordan deftly explores the themes of the mother-daughter relationship, the emotional scars left by history, the struggle to be authentic in the throes of great personal pain, and the transforming power of love.

Best of all, it is the story of Kay Graham herself. She was brought up in a family of great wealth, yet she learned and understood nothing about money. She is half-Jewish, yet -- incredibly -- remained unaware of it for many years.She describes herself as having been naive and awkward, yet intelligent and energetic. She married a man she worshipped, and he fascinated and educated her, and then, in his illness, turned from her and abused her. This destruction of her confidence and happiness is a drama in itself, followed by the even more intense drama of her new life as the head of a great newspaper and a great company, a famous (and even feared) woman in her own right. Hers is a life that came into its own with a vengeance -- a success story on every level.Graham's book is populated with a cast of fascinating characters, from fifty years of presidents (and their wives), to Steichen, Brancusi, Felix Frankfurter, Warren Buffett (her great advisor and protector), Robert McNamara, George ",

Walsch urges each of us to forge our own unique relationship with God, a God who is everywhere and speaks to us in all we do. It is up to us to stop and listen. It is up to us to respond . . . to begin the conversation. And a conversation is the first step, just as in any relationship, in establishing trust, in building friendship, in creating communion.

In Dave Barry's Guide to Marriage and/or Sex, one of America's most beloved writers turns his keen, if somewhat rheumy, eye to the institution of marriage.Dating. \"These are nonstereotypical times we live in, by which I mean that it is the responsibility of the woman to think up excuses that get progressively more obvious until the man figures out that the woman would rather chew on a rat pancreas.\"Sex. \"I'm afraid that we must talk here about sex in a very explicit manner, because we want to expand the Frontiers of Human Understanding, and also we want to sell as many books as possible to adolescent boys.\"Marriage. \"Most squabbles start with money. For example, you want to buy food, while your spouse wants to buy a thoroughbred racehorse. It's important, in these situations, for both of you to be willing to sit down and try to achieve a workable compromise. In this case, you could buy a thoroughbred racehorse and eat it.\"",

Now, in Sheila, he explores the making of evil - the depths beneath the lower depths of American society and the terrifying products of that netherworld where children are born into ultimate abandonment and abuse, where only a few survive and some emerge not fully human.One such survivor is the man known as Ghost.His personality has been formed, diamond-hard, in the crucible of chilly orphanages and hellish juvenile prisons. He has grown the way a baby alligator grows - in size alone, not in essence. He has no experience of nurture or education.He has become an instrument. A weapon to be used by predators. He works only with his hands. His work - his art - is killing. He is a superb killer: imaginative, efficient, precise, cold. He easily finds employment. When he does time, he emerges from prison neither hurt nor healed - exactly as before.But now he is no longer drifting. He has a mission that enlists all his banked energies: to track the woman who calls herself Sheila. She is a runway dancer. She is, like himself, a survivor of her own destruction, kept alive by anger. But Ghost knows that she has, for an instant, glimpsed the man behind the steel mask he wears, and that she is as astonished as he to find someone to connect with.Sheila has disappeared. And Ghost - desperate to reconnect - discovers the only route that might lead him back to her: straight through the cruel alleys, the topless bars, the dark tunnels of pornography and prostitution, into the raging center of a neo-Nazi enclave whose leader is instantly drawn to him...Sheila is the story of a killer stalking his destined prey, driven by forces he cannot understand. It is the story of a man searching for a witness to his own humanity.",

    "Authors": "By Price, Reynolds",
    "Description": "For over three decades, Reynolds Price has been one of America's most distinguished writers, in a career that has been remarkable both for its virtuosity and for the variety of literary forms he has embraced. Now he shows himself as much a master of the story as he is of the novel, in a volume that presents fifty stories, including two early collections - The Names and Faces of Heroes and Permanent Errors - as well as more than two dozen new stories that have never been gathered together before.In his introduction, Mr. Price explains how, after the publication of his first two collections, he wrote no new stories for almost twenty years. \"But once I needed - for unknown reasons in a new and radically altered life - to return to the story, it opened before me like a new chance...A collection like this then,\" he adds, \"...will show a writer's pre-occupations in ways the novel severely rations (novels are partly made for that purpose - the release from self, long flights through the Other). John Keats's assertion that 'the excellence of every Art is its intensity' has served as a license and standard for me. From the start my stories were driven by heat - passion and mystery, often passion for the mystery I've found in particular rooms and spaces and the people they threaten or shelter - and my general aim is the transfer of a spell of keen witness, perceived by the reader as warranted in character and act.\"There is, indeed, much for the reader to \"witness\" here of passion and mystery, of character and act. And the variety of stories - many of them set in Reynolds Price's native North Carolina, but a surprising number set in distant parts: Jerusalem in \"An Early Christmas,\" the American Southwest in \"Walking Lessons,\" and a number in Europe - will astonish even his most devoted readers. In short, The Collected Stories of Reynolds Price is as deeply rewarding a book as any he has yet published.",

His halfhearted efforts to seize the day and its present pleasures - first with a striving young photographer and later with a love of his youth who never loved him - cannot compete with his need to commune with the living and the dead that crowd his life: his father and uncle, pillars of the Establishment, sources of the \"genetic puritanism\" he has never tried to resist; his son, Sam, whose love he has only barely salvaged; his wife, once perfectly \"beautiful and suitable,\" now humiliated by him and half-scorned.

Then he explains the meaning behind the exciting new developments that have put cosmology in the headlines -- including the discovery of planets orbiting stars other than our sun, glimpses through the Hubble Space Telescope of how the universe looked when it was only a fraction of its present age, and the detection of structure in relic radiation from the big bang that may hint at the mechanisms of genesis.Ferris provides a lucid, nontechnical overview of current research and a forecast of where cosmological theory is likely to go in the twenty-first century. A master analogist, he presents accessible explanations of relativity and quantum physics, \"inflationary\" models indicating that the universe is much larger than had been thought, and \"string\" theories that portray all matter as made of space.The centerpiece of The Whole Shebang is a visionary account of near-future science, in which light is shed on the possibility that our universe is one among many universes, each with different physical laws and differing prospects for the emergence of life.The Whole Shebang explores questions that have occurred to even casual readers who are curious about nature on the largest scales: What does it mean to say that the universe is \"expanding,\" or that space is \"curved\"? How could there have been an \"origin\" of the universe; what happened \"before\"? Why is quantum uncertainty so puzzling to many scientists, and why do some regard it as one of theWritten with the literary flair that earned Ferris the accolade \"the greatest science writer in the world,\" The Whole Shebang interweaves probing scientific explication, lyrical descriptions, and finely honed profiles",

    "Title": "Lines in the Sand: Desert Storm and the Remaking of the Arab World",
    "Authors": "By Amos, Deborah",
    "Description": "For many Americans, the Gulf War served as an introduction to a part of the world about which they knew virtually nothing. It provided a kind of mass-marketed crash course in Middle Eastern politics, tradition, and history.But what did they learn?In Lines in the Sand, veteran Middle East journalist Deborah Amos provides a unique perspective on the war, looking beyond the stories that were reported over and over to get at the truth about the events that led up to the conflict, and to examine a year later the effects it had on the people of the region.Among the issues she explores are how America armed Hussein, providing him with much of the power and expertise he demonstrated in overrunning Kuwait; how the collapse of the Soviet Union led to dramatic changes in U.S. policy toward Iraq, which the Americans had supported in its long war with Iran; how the rich Arabs of the Gulf states found a common strategy with their poorer neighbors; how the PLO, forced to deal with an intra-Arab conflict that included Israeli influence on one side, came to support Hussein; how Saudi domestic policies affected U.S. military strategies how the burgeoning resistance movement in Kuwait was crushed after the war; and, how, despite the war and the upheaval among so many nations, very little of substance has truly changed.Deborah Amos brings a fresh perspective to the war, with new insights into the region's history and culture. She explores the volatility of the region and concludes that it is as unstable now as before. Most significantly, she looks at the war not just from a U.S. perspective, but from the point of view of Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.Lines in the Sand is dramatic war reporting at its best, by a top female journalist covering the first war in which the American military put women on the frontlines--and, ironically, from a place in which women aren't even allowed to drive.",

Why does it take courage to be rich? Because it takes courage to meet every obstacle and opportunity of life, to forgive ourselves and others for past mistakes, to imagine and achieve a future rich with possibility.   With her signature blend of inspirational and practical advice, Suze Orman asks us to look within, asserting her powerful conviction that once we achieve a state of emotional clarity regarding money, financial clarity will always follow. She guides us through a lifetime of financial issues, from relationships and prenuptial agreements to investment options, from the money we spend in daily life to the money we need for tomorrow. Finally, Suze takes on the seldom-explored subject of money and grace, the rewards it bestows and the responsibilities it confers.   Suze Orman may be the only financial planner for whom words like \"hope,\" \"acceptance,\" and \"courage\" are part of her daily lexicon. The Courage to Be Rich is a book that will change our very definitions of wealth and abundance.",

    "Title": "Basic Principles of Classical Ballet",
    "Authors": "By Vaganova, A. Ia.",
    "Description": "Although the stars of Russian ballet Anna Pavlova and Tamara Karsavina possessed a national manner of dancing, there was no truly Russian school of dancing until the 1930s. The development of this school was largely due to Mme. Vaganova (1879–1951), not only a great dancer but also the teacher of Galina Ulanova and many others and an unsurpassed theoretician.The principles of Vaganova's system are presented in this well-known book. Mme. Vaganova's aim of creating a personal approach to the Russian dance was based on the critical assimilation of the experience of her contemporaries. Her ability to choose the best of what had been accomplished in the various ballet traditions (French, Italian, and Russian) and combine these into a unified teaching practice in itself amounted to a new school of dance. She firmly believed that the teaching process should be a planned exercise, ever changing with innovations in the dance. She sought from her pupils emotional expressiveness, strictness of form, a resolute, energetic manner of performance, and the understanding of the underlying coordination of movements.Her book discusses all basic principles of ballet, grouping movements by fundamental types. Chapters cover battements, rotary movements of the legs, the arms, poses of the classical dance, connecting and auxiliary movements, jumps, beats, point work, and turns as well as material for a sample lesson. Diagrams show clearly the exact foot, leg, arm, and body positions for the proper execution of many steps and movements. The result is a fundamental theory of dance that offers dancers, teachers, and ballet lovers information often difficult to locate in other books. 118 illustrations.",

And, most importantly will Snoopy--that canine literary ace--ever be published?  \"To take a blank piece of paper and draw characters that people love and worry about is extremely satisfying.  It really does not matter what you are called or where your work is placed as long as it brings some kind of joy to some person some place.\" -- Charles SchulzPeanuts: A Golden Celebration honors the momentous 50th anniversary of Charlie Brown and the gang with over 1,000 carefully selected strips that tell the story of Peanutslike no other book before.  In Schulz's own words we learn how he came to create the world's most popular comic strip characters from nostalgic and sometimes painful memories of growing up--such as the agony of classroom Valentine exchange and the longing for a little red-haired girl. From the debut of Peanuts on October 2, 1950, to the golden jubilee, here are fifty years of the favorite episodes and the...\"firsts,\" such as the first time Lucy pulled the football away from Charlie Brown.  Included are scenes from the beloved Charlie Brown television. specials and the latest revival of the Broadway musical, You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown. These are the strips and events that have made Peanuts an awesome phenomenon, appearing in 2,600 newspapers worldwide everyday.  Not bad for a round-headed kid called Charlie Brown.

    "Description": "\"Poets live the lives all of us live,\" says Bill Moyers, \"with one big difference. They have the power--the power of the word--to create a world of thoughts and emotions other can share. We only have to learn to listen.\"In a series of fascinating conversations with thirty-four American poets, The Language Of Life celebrates language in its \"most exalted, wrenching, delighted, and concentrated form,\" and its unique power to re-create the human experience: falling in love, facing death, leaving home, playing basketball, losing faith, finding God. Listening to Linda McCarriston's award-winning poems about a child trapped in a violent home, or to Jimmy Santiago Baca explaining how words changed his life in prison, or to David Mura describing his Japanese American grandfather's experience in relocation camps, or to Sekou Sundiata stitching the magic of his childhood church in Harlem to the African tradition of storytelling, or to Gary Snyder invoking the natural wonder of mountains and rivers, or to Adrienne Rich calling for honesty in human relations, all testify to the necessity and clarity of the poet's voice, and all give hope that from such a wide variety of racial, ethnic, and religious threads we might yet weave a new American fabric.\"'Listen,' said the storytellers of old, 'listen and you shall hear,'\" explains Bill Moyers. The Language Of Life is a joyous, life-affirming invitation to listen, learn, and experience the exhilarating power of the spoken word.From the Trade Paperback edition.",

But when Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken, Jr., reported to the baseball field on September 6, 1995, for a record-breaking 2,131st consecutive time, Americans felt otherwise. In an era of big-money sports, strikes, and grandstanding, the hardest-working ballplayer in the world had single-handedly put the \"great\" back in America's greatest game.Now, with the candor and grace that have endeared him to fans, Ripken tells the story of his journey to that moment and beyond.Best of all, Cal takes us inside the brain of one of the game's smartest players. He dissects the dedication to craft it takes to be a shortstop - especially when you're six-foot-four. He takes us through his strategies at the plate and in the field, his attention to the tiniest detail of positioning, or glove selection, or batting stance. It's a private lesson with one of the true masters of the art of playing baseball.Cal Ripken knows what it means to make a commitment, like the one he's made to his hometown and its team for his whole career, and to his own family. In this rich and rewarding memoir, we find out why he gives back as much as he takes from the game and the fans - it's the only way he knows.",

    "Description": "As Americans, we face two fundamental questions:First, are we truly prepared to fight this new war to wipe out terrorism and terrorist regimes, and win it decisively -- no matter what sacrifices it requires or how long it takes?Second, are we once again prepared to teach our children the fundamental principles and values that make this country great -- the values that make this country worth fighting for, living for, and dying for?Sean Hannity is the hottest new phenomenon in TV and talk radio today. His gutsy, take-no-prisoners interviews and commentary on the Fox News Channel's Hannity & Colmes have made him one of cable television's most popular personalities. And his ascendance to the top of the talk radio world with ABC Radio's The Sean Hannity Show has won him a huge and devoted following that includes not only conservatives but anyone else who values straight talk over pandering and excuses.Now, in Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity offers a survey of the world -- political, social, and cultural -- as he sees it. Devoting special attention to 9/11, the war on terror, and the continuing threat we face at home and abroad, he makes clear that the greatest challenge we have to overcome may not be an attack from overseas, but the slow compromising of our national character. And he asks why, particularly in this time of war, should we entrust our future to the voices of the Left -- the very people who have spent decades ravaging so many of our core values and traditions?Our nation, as Hannity reminds us, was founded on the idea of freedom. And in order to protect our freedoms, he argues, we must stand vigilant against liberal attempts to compromise our strengths. From our military and intelligence forces, to our borders and airports, to our unified commitment to root out terrorists at home and abroad, he reveals how our strongest lines of defense have come under attack -- by left-wing voices within our government, media, schools, and elsewhere. And he shows how even do",

Hammerschlag responded almost by rote, rattling off his medical education, intership, and certification. The old man replied,\"Do you know how to dance?\"To humor Santiago, Hammerschlag shuffled his feet at the priest's bedside. Despite his condition, Santiago got up and demonstrated the proper steps. \"You must be able to dance if you are to heal people,\"he admonished the young doctor.\"I can teach you my steps, but you will have to hear your own music.\"Hammerschlag synthesizes his Jewish heritage with his experience with Native Americans to produce a practice open to all methods of healing. He discovers the wisdom of the Pueblo priest's question to his Western doctor, \"Do you know how to dance?\"",

    "Description": "A deadly epidemic was sweeping across Pern! Everyone, holder and dragonrider alike, pitched in to help—except Nerilka’s father, who refused to share Fort Hold’s bounty with the other Holds. So, ashamed of her family and determined to do her part, Nerilka packed up medicines and supplies and sneaked off to aid her people. Her quest to help wherever she was most needed led her finally to Ruatha Hold, where Lord Alessan was frantically preparing the precious serum needed for mass inoculations against the dread plague. Nerilka had long ago abandoned her hope of marriage and a home of her own. Now she found happiness in being useful and appreciated—first the Healers and then Alessan made very clear that they were grateful for her help. She had no idea that her new path would change the course of her life forever!",

    "Authors": "By Peterson, James",
    "Description": "From the James Beard award--winning author of Sauces-a new classic on French cuisine for today's cookHis award-winning books have won the praise of The New York Times and Gourmet magazine as well as such culinary luminaries as chefs Daniel Boulud, Jeremiah Tower, and Alice Waters. Now James Peterson brings his tremendous stores of culinary knowledge, energy, and imagination to this fresh and inspiring look at the classic dishes of French cuisine. With a refreshing, broadminded approach that embraces different French cooking styles-from fine dining to bistro-style cooking, from hearty regional fare to nouvelle cuisine-Peterson uses fifty \"foundation\" French dishes as the springboard to preparing a variety of related dishes. In his inventive hands, the classic Moules à la marinière inspires the delightful Miniature Servings of Mussels with Sea Urchin Sauce and Mussel Soup with Garlic Puree and Saffron, while the timeless Duck à l'orange gives rise to the subtle Salad of Sautéed or Grilled Duck Breasts and Sautéed Duck Breasts with Classic Orange Sauce. Through these recipes, Peterson reveals the underlying principles and connections in French cooking that liberate readers to devise and prepare new dishes on their own. With hundreds recipes and dazzling color photography throughout, Glorious French Food gives everyone who enjoys cooking access to essential French cooking traditions and techniques and helps them give free reign to the intuition and spontaneity that lie in the heart-and stomach-of every good cook. It will take its place on the shelf right next to Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking.",

    "Authors": "By Bridges, William",
    "Description": "Every day the newspapers report more corporate mergers and restructuring. Every day thousands of lives are altered by these changes. Most managers and employees, however, do not have the experience to effectively work through such transitions. In Managing Transitions, William Bridges provides a clear understanding of what change does to employees and what employees in transition can do to an organization, and he shows how to minimize the distress and disruptions caused by change.Directed at managers and employees in today&#39;s corporations, where change is necessary to revitalize and improve corporate performance, Managing Transitions  addresses the fact that it is people who have to carry out the change. It not only talks about what should be done, but also shows how to do it, giving managers practical ways to bring the people ”on board.” Armed with this new information, managers will look at future changes in a new way, no longer feeling anxious and hopeless, but rather looking at opportunities.Everybody talks about ”managing change” and ”resistance to change,” but Bridges is the first to talk about what is going on inside the people who have to make the change work. He is the first to provide any real sense of the emotional impact of change and what can be done to keep it from disrupting the entire organization. Bridges&#39;s years of experience helping organizations and individuals successfully take control of change has proven the need for specific, concrete guidelines for dealing with change.  Managing Transitions provides these guidelines.",

    "Title": "Mortgaging The Earth: The World Bank, Environmental Impoverishment, and the Crisis of Development",
    "Authors": "By Rich, Bruce",
    "Description": "The World Bank is the single biggest source of finance for international development, and its policies have a critical impact on the future of more than 110 borrowing countries. In this dramatic and lively new critique, Bruce Rich, internationally known expert on the environment and the World Bank, analyzes how the Bank has become a seemingly unstoppable and often destructive environmental and political force.The author chronicles the life-and-death impact of Bank-funded projects around the world: huge dams that have forced the resettlement of millions of the poorest people on earth, road building and jungle colonization schemes in Brazil, Indonesia, and Africa that have left vast deforestation and social conflict in their wake, and much more. Rich also recounts the bold grassroots campaigns of nongovernmental groups seeking alternatives to Bank-style development.Confidential internal Bank documents expose chronic misrepresentations by Bank management to its donor nations and to the public. Rich reveals how senior officials continue to push money into projects with disastrous ecological and human rights consequences, despite early and persistent protests of Bank staff. He shows how repeatedly and without political accountability the Bank has increased its support for regimes that torture and murder their subjects, from Ceaucescu's Romania to Suharto's Indonesia.Mortgaging the Earth explains the so-called pressure to lend that emerges as a leitmotif in the Bank's fifty-year history and shows how this institutional dynamic has taken on a damaging life of its own. Rich traces the history of the Bank, from its inception at Bretton Woods, where it was conceived as a way to funnel reconstruction loans for war-torn Europe, through the surreally top-down tenure of Robert McNamara to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit. At Rio, governments poured billions of dollars more into the Bank to save our global environment - while the Bank financed new ecological disasters.The World Ban",

    "Title": "Life in Ancient Egypt",
    "Authors": "By Erman, Adolf",
    "Description": "What was it like to live in the ancient land watered by the Nile, thousands of years before Christ was born? How did a man earn his living, what did he wear, where did he go in his leisure time? What was the relationship between an ordinary Egyptian and his government, his wife, his children? Was life for him grim or optimistic, difficult or easy, reverent or worldly? Did his people travel, explore, conquer? Were they very much different from those of the other great civilizations of antiquity, the Greek and the Roman? What was the nature of their science, art, magic, religion? If the past has lessons for the present, what can we deduce from ancient Egyptian life that is of value to us today?For generations, scholar, specialists, and general readers have been turning to a monumental sourcebook for the answers to such questions: Life in Ancient Egypt by Adolf Erman. It is one of the most influential and frequently consulted works on Egyptology ever written, a classic in its field and the basis of numerous other studies and works. It is still one of a very few books that offer the modern reader so satisfying, informative, and complete a survey in one volume.Erman, a rigorously trained scholar, Director of the Egyptian Museum in Berlin, and author of standard works on Egyptology, covers his subject thoroughly and with a wealth of interesting, concrete detail. He examines ancient Egypt’s political structure, crime and police systems, domestic life and kinships, dress, amusements, religion, learning, mathematics, magic and folk beliefs, literature, art, agriculture, trades, arts and crafts, commerce, warfare, and much else. His objective point of view, eschewing romanticism on the one hand and frigid pedantry on the other, gives us a treatment that is as trustworthy in fact as it is evocative in effect — as Professor Jon Manchip White says in his new introduction for this edition, “From first to last … a superb performance.” The scholar, the student and the mer",

    "Title": "Three Gospels",
    "Authors": "By Price, Reynolds (EDT)",
    "Description": "A decade after he published his famous first novel, A Long and Happy Life, Reynolds Price began a serious study of the Hebrew and Greek narratives which combine to form that crucial document of Western civilization we call the Bible. Since early childhood, Price had known Bible stories of patriarchs, kings, prophets, and the boldly assertive women of Ancient Israel, as well as the four-fold gospel story of the life of Jesus -- another Jew whose career has exerted immense fascination on subsequent history.  In Price's early middle age, however, he felt compelled to go further than simple reading; he began to investigate the rudiments of the Bible stories as deeply as possible. He focused on the Hebrew and Greek originals that are unquestionably the most discussed and annotated texts with the close assistance of other literal versions and of numerous scholarly commentaries, old and modern. He was likewise encouraged and helped by frequent discussions with distinguished scholar-colleagues at Duke University, where he has taught since 1958.  As the work continued over several years, Price expanded his translation attempts into the Greek New Testament. And soon he had begun an informal navigation of the shoals of Koine Greek -- that common Mediterranean dialect in which a good deal of the business of the Roman empire was conducted and in which the gospels and all other books of the New Testament were written. Gradually, his translations of separate incidents from the four gospels evolved into a literal translation of the whole of the oldest gospel, Mark. His first version of Mark appeared, along with other translations from the Old and New Testaments, in A Palpable God (Atheneum, 1978). The book met with a wide and favorable reception from scholars, writers, and critics.  Price's studies have expanded steadily in the intervening decades; and in recent years he has worked at both a revised version of his early translation of Mark and an entirely new literal version of the",

In this extraordinary collection of hundreds of internal government and Communist Party documents, secretly smuggled out of China, we learn how these events came to pass from behind the scenes. The material reveals how the most important decisions were made; and how the turmoil split the ruling elite into radically opposed factions. The book includes the minutes of the crucial meetings at which the Elders decided to cashier the pro-reform Party secretary Zhao Ziyang and to replace him with Jiang Zemin, to declare martial law, and finally to send the troops to drive the students from the Square.Just as the Pentagon Papers laid bare the secret American decision making behind the Vietnam War and changed forever our view of the nation's political leaders, so too has The Tiananmen Papers altered our perception of how and why the events of June 4 took the shape they did. Its publication has proven to be a landmark event in Chinese and world history.",

    "Authors": "By Mellan, Olivia",
    "Description": "\"For most of us, money is never just money,\" writes Olivia Mellan. It can also represent love, power, happiness, security, self-esteem, and so much more. As a result, we have intense feelings about money - feelings we often hide from - which prevent us from dealing with it productively, and which make it a primary source of anxiety and conflict in our lives and relationships.Olivia Mellan knows how to help individuals and couples resolve their money conflicts. In Money Harmony, she presents the innovative program she has successfully used for more than a decade in her private practice and in workshops and seminars nationwide. Her reassuring, positive approach gives readers insight through real-life examples and conversations and self-knowledge exercises; teaches readers how to evaluate the impact of childhood experiences on their current money attitudes and behaviors; demystifies the common myths about money that can lead to extreme actions, running the gamut from overspending to avoidance to hoarding; and explains the strengths and weaknesses of various money personality styles, allowing readers to come to terms, comfortably, with their own styles.The second half of Money Harmony is devoted to couples, whose hidden money agendas and often opposing styles can cause conflict. Mellan offers a variety of proven communication techniques: dynamic activities and creative \"moneytalks\" that teach couples how to appreciate and respect differing styles, to resolve simple and complex money conflicts, and to set individual and joint goals. For anyone whose life or relationship is affected by money, Money Harmony is essential reading.",

    "Title": "Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?:  Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround",
    "Authors": "By Gerstner, Louis V., Jr.",
    "Description": "In 1990, IBM had its most profitable year ever. By 1993, the computer industry had changed so rapidly the company was on its way to losing $16 billion and IBM was on a watch list for extinction -- victimized by its own lumbering size, an insular corporate culture, and the PC era IBM had itself helped invent.Then Lou Gerstner was brought in to run IBM. Almost everyone watching the rapid demise of this American icon presumed Gerstner had joined IBM to preside over its continued dissolution into a confederation of autonomous business units. This strategy, well underway when he arrived, would have effectively eliminated the corporation that had invented many of the industry's most important technologies.Instead, Gerstner took hold of the company and demanded the managers work together to re-establish IBM's mission as a customer-focused provider of computing solutions. Moving ahead of his critics, Gerstner made the hold decision to keep the company together, slash prices on his core product to keep the company competitive, and almost defiantly announced, \"The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision.\"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? tells the story of IBM's competitive and cultural transformation. In his own words, Gerstner offers a blow-by-blow account of his arrival at the company and his campaign to rebuild the leadership team and give the workforce a renewed sense of purpose. In the process, Gerstner defined a strategy for the computing giant and remade the ossified culture bred by the company's own success.The first-hand story of an extraordinary turnaround, a unique case study in managing a crisis, and a thoughtful reflection on the computer industry and the principles of leadership, Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? sums up Lou Gerstner's historic business achievement. Taking readers deep into the world of IBM's CEO, Gerstner recounts the high-level meetings and explains the pressure-filled, no-turning-back decisions that had to be made. He also offers his hard-won",

    "Title": "American Artists On Art: From 1940 To 1980 (Icon Editions)",
    "Authors": "By Johnson, Ellen H. (EDT)",
    "Description": "From the Preface:The fact that so much of modern art has devoted itself to the exploration and assertion of its own identity is reflected in, but does not explain, the increasing amount of writing and talking on the part of contemporary artists. Rather, the whole history of the changing role of art and artists in a democratic, industrial, and technological society stands behind the spate of artists' words and the public's hunger for them?even some of the general public out there beyond art's little circle. Statements by artists appeal somewhat the way drawings do: they bring us, or at least they hold the promise of bringing us, closer to the artist's thoughts and feelings and to an understanding of his or her modus operandi; they hold the keys to a mysterious realm. And sometimes they offer us the sheer pleasure of good reading. Such is the primary raison d'?e of this book.Its other motivation is educational, and stems from the frustrating lack, in teaching contemporary art, of any single compilation of statements by American artists from 1940 to the present.? This anthology differs in several respects from those others that do include documents of American art since 1940.? The selection I have made is devoted exclusively to statements of artists; it is limited to the last four decades; it presents in a single volume a representative and fairly comprehensive coverage of major developments in American art beginning with Abstract Expressionism; and, whenever possible, it cities the first, or among the very earliest, documents signalizing a shift in the definition, intent, or direction of art.?",

    "Description": "Gail Carson Levine charmed the world with Ella Enchanted, her spirited retelling of the Cinderella story. Now this award-winning author turns her attention to two more classic fairy tales, and deftly turns them upside down and inside out with her trademark wit and hilarity. In The Fairy's Mistake, two very different sisters have two very different encounters with the fairy Ethelinda. Rosella is kind and helpful. Her reward: Jewels and gems tumble out of her mouth whenever she speaks. Myrtle is rude and spiteful. Her punishment: Bugs and vipers slither out of her mouth. The fairy Ethelinda feels she's meted out justice just right--until she discovers Rosella has been locked up by a greedy prince and Myrtle is having the time of her life!  In The Princess Test, King Humphrey has decided its time for his son, Prince Nicholas, to marry. But he must make sure the bride is a real princess. So he devises a series of princess tests, designed to weed out the phonies and the fakes. Meanwhile, Nicholas has fallen in love with Lorelei, a mere blacksmith's daughter. She's no princess, but he wants to marry her all the same--but how will she ever pass the terrible tests?In these first two delightfully entertaining, laugh-out-loud Princess Tales, Gail Levine gently spoofs the notion that fairies are always right and that tests can never prove a persons worth, but holds fast to the notion that true love will always win in the end.",

We've become a nation of lonely serial daters, consumed by work, suspicious of romance, so unsure of finding lasting love that we settle for dispiriting blind dates and the company of friends. In short, we've forgotten how to fall in love.But help is on the way. In Why Can't I Pall in Love? Shmuley Boteach, author of the international bestseller Kosher Sex, offers hope for anyone who wonders why love is so hard to find.

And his Twelve LoveSteps program describes measures anyone can take to make the dream of love a reality, including:Heal your love woundCall a moratorium on datingLet go of people who are wasting your timeRecapture your mental virginityFilled with helpful exercises -- including a Declaration of Dependence to be signed and shared with potential mates -- Why Can't I Fall in Love? offers a refreshingly positive strategy to help you embrace love...and change your life.",

No longer a small, informal co-op, All Souls has grown. New legal partners, exasperated with Sharon's free-wheeling ways, want to kick her upstairs with a raise, perks, and a \"career opportunity\" that will chain her to a desk forever.Offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal, Sharon is in turmoil. And to make matters worse, Hy has disappeared. His abandoned plane, wrecked rental car, and a road map point to RKI, a firm of international security consultants with a reputation for questionable, unorthodox tactics and clients engaged in controversial research. Sharon discovers that they hired Hy as a free-lance operative and that they, too, are looking for him.Determined to find out what has happened, Sharon pushes aside her career concerns at All Souls and plunges into a search that will force her to take unlikely sanctuary in her abandoned San Diego childhood home and find and unexpected ally in her wild, unpredictable brother John. From the drive-by hiring hall for illegal aliens in Imperial Beach to an opulent villa on the Mexican coast, she will track down every clue in a complex plot that builds to a breathtaking climax on the treacherous canyon trails that lead back across the border. There, in a no-man's-land where terrified pollos defy la migra in a desperate bid for freedom...and where decisions won't wait, Sharon must make the tough choices that put her own life, her own freedom, and everything she holds dear at deadly risk.",

Yet he was also a staunch Catholic, and when Henry broke with the Church in 1531 after the Pope had refused to grant him a divorce from Catherine of Aragon, More resigned the Chancellorship. In 1534, Parliament passed a bill requiring all subjects to take an oath acknowledging the supremacy of England's king over all foreign sovereigns—including the Pope. More refused, was imprisoned, and finally was executed in 1535. An enduring modern classic, A Man for All Seasons \"challenges the mind, and, in the end, touches the heart\" (New York Times).",

So when he learns that he was made for someone in North Carolina, Jeremy hops right off to deliver himself to his new owner. But North Carolina is a long way from England, as Jeremy quickly learns. Before he can be safely home, Jeremy must rely on help from many people. There's old Mr. Pruneholt, who shows Jeremy where to find America; the kindly sea captain and his chattering parrot, Jethro, who see Jeremy across the water, and the unforgettable Village Dear. Most important of all are the family of young bunnies who teach Jeremy how wonderful it is to be needed. Though he'd love to stay with them, Jeremy can't forget that he has someone waiting for him and must keep moving until he arrives at her doorstep.   Jeremy, the Tale of an Honest Bunny is a story of adventure and friendship, full of humor, inspiration, and joy. It is the story of any child who is away from home-and the miracles found on the way to being safe at last.   Jan Karon says, \"I wanted to do something for my daughter that would last a long time-perhaps even a lifetime. So I wrote a book about a bunny named Jeremy who went on a journey. In the story I included the consoling verse from Psalm 91, the verse we might all hope and pray for our children: \"He will give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.\"   Throughout the book there are detailed watercolor illustrations from acclaimed artist Teri Weidner. Designed with an old-fashioned charm to match the story's flavor, the book even includes a ribbon with which to keep your place as you read.

In clear, spirited prose, Bloom argues that the social and political crises of contemporary America are part of a larger intellectual crisis: the result of a dangerous narrowing of curiosity and exploration by the university elites. Now, in this twenty-fifth anniversary edition, acclaimed author and journalist Andrew Ferguson contributes a new essay that describes why Bloom’s argument caused such a furor at publication and why our culture so deeply resists its truths today.",

Born in the cataclysm of the antislavery movement, the Republican Party was from the first - and remains today - the most successful revolutionary party in the history of democracy. And the Party's story - from Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt to Nixon, Reagan, and Gingrich - is the pageant of American politics.Using primary sources long overlooked by traditional historians and employing a novelist's eye and ear for the telling detail, Batchelor, in his sweeping narrative, encompasses one and a half centuries of Republican battle and paradox.",

    "Description": "Nine out of ten Americans own a Bible, but how much do they know about the one book that has influenced human history more than any other? Don't Know Much About the Bible by New York Times bestselling author Kenneth C. Davis is designed to illuminate everything we need to know about the Good Book but never learned.With wit, authority, and intelligence, Davis brings the world of the Old and New Testaments to vivid life, setting the panorama of the Scriptures against the historical events that shaped them; clearing up misconceptions and mistranslations; summarizing Bible stories, parables, and miracles; and adding fresh new insights to the world's most owned, least understood book.Davis is uniquely qualified for the assignment. The creator of the bestselling Don't Know Much About series, which has more than 1.6 million copies in print, he now illuminates the bestselling book of all time using his inimitable question-and-answer approach and providing a key to the people, places, and \"household names\" we need to unlock \"The Greatest Story Ever Told.\"Relying on up-to-date research and improved translations, Davis set out to uncover what the Bible says -- and doesn't say. Don't Know Much About the Bible is the result of his efforts and includes the following observations: There are two different Creation stories told in Genesis, but no apple in the Garden of Eden story. Noah invented wine and cursed the son who had seen him drunk and naked. There was no \"coat of many colors\" in the story of Joseph and his jealous brothers, but rather a long-sleeved robe. Moses didn't write the Torah and he didn't part the Red Sea in his escape from Pharaoh. The Sixth Commandment does not condemn all killing. Jericho's walls may have tumbled down because the city lies on a fault line. King David probably didn't kill Goliath and didn't write the Psalms.",

    "Title": "Language and Myth",
    "Authors": "By Cassirer, Ernst",
    "Description": "In this important study Ernst Cassirer analyzes the non-rational thought processes that go to make up culture. He demonstrates that beneath both language and myth there lies an unconscious \"grammar\" of experience, whose categories and canons are not those of logical thought. He shows that this prelogical \"logic\" is not merely an undeveloped state of rationality, but something basically different, and that this archaic mode of thought still has enormous power over even our most rigorous thought, in language, poetry and myth.The author analyzes brilliantly such seemingly diverse (yet related) phenomena as the metaphysics of the Bhagavat Gita, the Melanesian concept of Mana, the Naturphilosophie of Schelling, modern poetry, Ancient Egyptian religion, and symbolic logic. He covers a vast range of material that is all too often neglected in studies of human thought.These six essays are of great interest to the student of philosophy or the philosophy of science, the historian, or the anthropologist. They are also remarkably timely for students of literature, what with the enormous emphasis placed upon \"myth\" in modern literary speculation. This book is not superficial speculation by a dabbler, but a penetrating study by one of the most profound and sensitive philosophic minds of our time.",

It's the eve of the one and only presidential debate, and he's been sent to Colonial Williamsburg by his magazine, The New American Tatler, to cover the event. An important assignment, but pretty routine for a journalist of Chapman's abilities.The campaign itself, however, has been anything but routine. The American people face an impossible choice between apparent evil and apparent incompetence: The Republican candidate, David Donald Meredith, a handsome, charismatic figure and a riveting speaker, is a fundamentalist demagogue, a nativist, and probably a racist - none but the most fervent ideologues doubts that his election would tear the country apart. The Democrat, Paul L. Greene, is everything Meredith is not - liberal, earnest, and utterly colorless - and is so far behind in the polls that he has all but conceded the race weeks before the election.As the handlers, the press corps, the camera crews, and the campaign operators assemble in Williamsburg for the final battle of the campaign, a different sort of battle is taking place on the debate panel. Reporters have been given devastating anonymous reports about Meredith's personal life. There's no time to check them out, but using them could throw the election to Greene. In utter secrecy, a decision is made. By the time the debate is over, American politics and journalism have been changed forever and the four panelists have vaulted to mega-stardom. And Tom Chapman is hot on the trail of the biggest story of his career: the debate behind the last debate.",

    "Description": "\"The jet fighter is one of the great icons of the second half of the twentieth century, a symbol of achievement, of technical excellence, of ultimate modernity, of latent military power.\"  So begins Ivan Rendall, a former Royal Air Force pilot, in this thrilling first-ever history of the most seductive and deadly of all of man's weapons of war. From its birth in battle during the last days of World War II to its current aeronautical peak, the jet fighter has always been the king of the sky. Rendall's Rolling Thunder is the celebration of a machine, and a culture, for which \"winning is about accepting that there is no such thing as second-best.\"  Rendall's scrupulous history is driven by a strong thesis: jets may depend upon technological advances, but the human edge supplied by their pilots has determined their success or failure in all times and places. In this respect, the West has triumphed over its enemies. Beginning with the dangerously fast but hopelessly outnumbered German Me 262, jets and the men who flew them quickly became potent physical and psychological weapons. From the ruins of a defeated Germany came the now-familiar look of swept-back wings and with them the secret of supersonic flight. Less than a decade later, the two World War II allies most responsible for Germany's defeat would meet as enemies in Korea. Their planes -- the American F-86 Saber and Russian MiG-15 -- clashed over the Yalu River in what American pilots called \"MiG Alley.\" Diving from 40,000 feet and flying through dry riverbeds so low that their engines kicked up dirt, both sides' machines soon proved their worth.  In Vietnam, American fighter pilots involved in the costly \"Rolling Thunder\" campaign again proved the value of the American emphasis on individualism as taught in the \"Top Gun\" school of aeronautics. Rendall vividly describes pilots in F-4 Phantoms and F-105 Thunderchiefs dodging SA-2 surface-to-air missiles in the \"ultimate test of man versus machine.\"  Recent uses of ",

Two hours after their jump, all but three of these men were dead or mortally burned. Haunted by these deaths for forty years, Norman Maclean puts back together the scattered pieces of the Mann Gulch tragedy.Young Men and Fire won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1992.\"A magnificent drama of writing, a tragedy that pays tribute to the dead and offers rescue to the living.... Maclean's search for the truth, which becomes an exploration of his own mortality, is more compelling even than his journey into the heart of the fire. His description of the conflagration terrifies, but it is his battle with words, his effort to turn the story of the 13 men into tragedy that makes this book a classic.\"—from New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice, Best Books of 1992\"A treasure: part detective story, part western, part tragedy, part elegy and wholly eloquent ghost story in which the dead and the living join ranks cheerfully, if sometimes eerily, in a search for truth and the rest it brings.\"—Joseph Coates, Chicago Tribune\"An astonishing book. In compelling language, both homely and elegant, Young Men and Fire miraculously combines a fascinating primer on fires and firefighting, a powerful, breathtakingly real reconstruction of a tragedy, and a meditation on writing, grief and human character.... Maclean's last book will stir your heart and haunt your memory.\"—Timothy Foote, USA Today\"Beautiful.... A dark American idyll of which the language can be proud.\"—Robert M. Adams, The New York Review of Books\"Young Men and Fire is redolent of Melville.

His gutsy, take-no-prisoners interviews and commentary on the Fox News Channel's Hannity & Colmes have made him one of cable television's most popular personalities. And his ascendance to the top of the talk radio world with ABC Radio's The Sean Hannity Show has won him a huge and devoted following that includes not only conservatives but anyone else who values straight talk over pandering and excuses.Now, in Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity offers a survey of the world—political, social, and cultural—as he sees it. Devoting special attention to 9/11, the war on terror, and the continuing threat we face at home and abroad, he makes clear that the greatest challenge we have to overcome may not be an attack from overseas, but the slow compromising of our national character. And he asks why, particularly in this time of war, should we entrust our future to the voices of the Left—the very people who have spent decades ravaging so many of our core values and traditions?Our nation, as Hannity reminds us, was founded on the idea of freedom. And in order to protect our freedoms, he argues, we must stand vigilant against liberal attempts to compromise our strengths. From our military and intelligence forces, to our borders and airports, to our unified commitment to root out terrorists at home and abroad, he reveals how our strongest lines of defense have come under attack—by left-wing voices within our government, media, schools, and elsewhere. And he shows how even domestic",

    "Authors": "By Spencer, Camika",
    "Description": "It's a Sunday morning, and while most people are thinking about getting the paper and breakfast, Gregory Alston has something other than eggs on his mind.  Today he's going to propose to Adrian Jenkins, his girlfriend of three years.  But when he actually does, all hell breaks loose and he gets a lot more than he bargained for.  His mother returns from France, where she's been living as a jazz singer since leaving her family in Texas nearly twenty years ago.  His Holy Roller sister, Shreese, complains that Adrian is too \"worldly\" for him, even though she herself is falling for the shady, charismatic pastor of her church.  And his boys-who run the gamut from player to buffoon-react to the news of his engagement with grief and disbelief. And if that's not enough, he's got Adrian, who has more skeletons in her closet than a haunted house.  What's a brother to do? When All Hell Breaks Loose is a debut novel about black twenty-somethings that is fast and funny.  It's also a peek into the minds of young black men.  Camika Spencer won't just have you laughing-she'll have you looking in the mirror to see if she's talking about you.",

While the aspiring politician Callicles propounds the view that might is right, and the rhetorician Gorgias argues that oratory and the power to persuade represent 'the greatest good', Socrates insists on the duty of politicians to consider the welfare of their citizens - a duty he believed had been dishonoured in the Athens of his time. The dialogue offers insights into how classical Athens was governed, as well as creating a theoretical framework that has been highly influential on subsequent political debate.",

    "Title": "Freud's Wishful Dream Book",
    "Authors": "By Welsh, Alexander",
    "Description": "Although it is customary to credit Freud's self-analysis, it may be more accurate, Alexander Welsh argues, to say that psychoanalysis began when The Interpretation of Dreams was published in the last weeks of the nineteenth century. Only by going public with his theory--that dreams manifest hidden wishes--did Freud establish a position to defend and embark upon a career. That position and career have been among the most influential in this century. In August 1899, Freud wrote to Wilhelm Fliess of the dream book in terms reminiscent of Dante's Inferno. Beginning from a dark wood, this modern journey features \"a concealed pass though which I lead the reader--my specimen dream with its peculiarities, details, indiscretions, bad jokes--and then suddenly the high ground and the view and the question, Which way do you wish to go now?\" Physician that he is, Freud appoints himself guide rather than hero, yet the way \"you\" wish to go is very much his prescribed way. In Welsh's book, readers are invited on Freud's journey, to pause at each concealed pass in his seminal work and ask where the guide is taking them and why. Along the way, Welsh shows how Freud's arbitrary turnings are themselves wishful, intended to persuade by pleasing the reader and author alike; that his interest in secrets and his self-proclaimed modest ambition are products of their time; and that the book may best be read as a romance or serial comedy. \"Some of the humor throughout,\" Welsh notes, \"can only be understood as a particular kind of fine performance.\" Welsh offers the first critical overview of the argument in Freud's masterpiece and of the author who presents himself as guide.",

    "Authors": "By Bergen, Peter L.",
    "Description": "On September 11, 2001, the world in which we live was changed forever. The twin towers of the World Trade Center came crashing down, one side of the Pentagon burst into flame, and more than six thousand men, women, and children lost their lives in the most deadly terrorist attack on American soil. As shocking as it was, it had been long in the making: The assault was the most sophisticated and horrifying in a series of operations masterminded by Osama bin Laden and his Jihad group -- an organization that CNN's terrorism analyst Peter Bergen calls Holy War, Inc.  One of only a handful of Western journalists to have interviewed the world's most wanted man face to face, Peter Bergen has produced the definitive book on the Jihadist network that operates globally and in secrecy. In the course of four years of investigative reporting, he has interviewed scores of insiders -- from bin Laden associates and family members to Taliban leaders to CIA officials -- and traveled to Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom to learn the truth about bin Laden's al Queda organization and his mission.  Immense in scope and unnerving in its findings, Holy War, Inc. reveals:   How bin Laden lives, travels, and communicates with his \"cells.\" How his role in the crushing defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan made him a hero to Muslims all over the world -- and equipped him to endure a long and bloody siege. How the CIA ended up funding -- to the tune of three billion dollars -- radical, anti-American Afghan groups allied to bin Laden. How the attacks that foreshadowed the destruction of the World Trade Center -- among them the bombings of the American embassies in Africa and the warship USS Cole in Yemen -- were planned and executed. The dimensions of bin Laden's personal fortune, and why freezing his assets is both futile and nearly impossible. The ideology of bin Laden's number two, the man who has influenced him most profoundly in his holy war -- the Egyptian Ayma",

That book ended in 1972, with McCain’s release from imprisonment in Vietnam. This is the rest of his story, about his great American journey from the U.S. Navy to his electrifying run for the presidency, interwoven with heartfelt portraits of the mavericks who have inspired him through the years—Ted Williams, Theodore Roosevelt, visionary aviation proponent Billy Mitchell, Marlon Brando in Viva Zapata!, and, most indelibly, Robert Jordan. It was Jordan, Hemingway’s protagonist in For Whom the Bell Tolls, who showed McCain the ideals of heroism and sacrifice, stoicism and redemption, and why certain causes, despite the costs, are . . .Worth the Fighting ForAfter five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, naval aviator John McCain returned home a changed man. Regaining his health and flight-eligibility status, he resumed his military career, commanding carrier pilots and serving as the navy’s liaison to what is sometimes ironically called the world’s most exclusive club, the United States Senate. Accompanying Senators John Tower and Henry “Scoop” Jackson on international trips, McCain began his political education in the company of two masters, leaders whose standards he would strive to maintain upon his election to the U.S. Congress. There, he learned valuable lessons in cooperation from a good-humored congressman from the other party, Morris Udall. In 1986, McCain was elected to the U.S. Senate, inheriting the seat of another role model, Barry Goldwater.During his time in public office, McCain has seen acts of principle and acts of craven self-interest. He describes both ex-tremes in these pages, with his characteristic straight talk and humor. He writes honestly of the lowest point in his career, the Keating Five savings and loan debacle, as well as his triumphant moments—his return to Vietnam and his efforts to normalize rela",

    "Title": "Plain and Simple: A Woman's Journey to the Amish",
    "Authors": "By Bender, Sue",
    "Description": "Twenty years ago, while walking through a men's clothing store in\" Sag Harbor, New York, Sue Bender found herself drawn to an array of old Amish quilts that served as a background to a display of tweeds. She was immediately struck by their deep, saturated colors, the geometric simplicity of their design, and their quiet power. \"They spoke directly to me,\" she writes. \"They knew something.They went straight to my heart.\" That was the beginning of her \"journey of the spirit.\"Plain and Simple, illustrated with the author's own drawings, is the gentle, eloquent story of that journey. Bender, a wife, a mother, and a dedicated artist from Berkeley, California, sought out Amish families that would allow her-one of the outsiders the Amish call the \"English\"-- to visit and share in their daily fives.In language as spare and vivid as Amish art, Bender recounts her venture into an entirely different world, the seemingly timeless world of the Amish, a landscape of immense inner quiet. With an inquiring eye, she describes the months she spent in Iowa and Ohio with two Amish families. She illuminates the everyday rhythms of their world and conveys the life of the people who taught her about simplicity, commitment, and the joy of doing what you do well.In nine chapters, as interrelated and well-crafted as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt, Bender speaks to the seeker in us all and reveals how she was drawn to -- and changed by -- the Amish values of austerity, humility, and the ordinary. \"How\" they live reflects what they believe\" she writes. \"Their life is their art!\"After living and working with these people whose values were so unlike her own, Bender was able to return home and rework her \"crazy quilt\" life into a new pattern. \"I thought I was going to learn more about their quilts,\" she writes, \"but the quilts were only guides, leading me to what I really needed to learn, to answer a question I hadn't yet formed: \"Is there another way to lead a good life?\"",

By Zola's death in 1902 it had come to symbolize the call for freedom from oppression so forcefully that the crowd which gathered at his State funeral chanted \"Germinal! Germinal!\"  While it is a dramatic novel of working life and everyday relationships, Germinal is also a complex novel of ideas, given fresh vigor and power in this new translation. It is also the thirteenth book in the Rougon-Macquart cycle, which celebrates its centenary in October 1993 with a new film version of Germinal starring Gerard Depardieu.",

To date, these books have sold two and a half million copies, and continue to hit bestseller lists every week.   The Education of the Heart   gives readers access to the wellspring of wisdom that Moore drew on when creating these seminal works. Ideal for reading groups, the book includes a study guide that offers suggestions for discussion.

    "Authors": "By Frohnmayer, John",
    "Description": "Brimming with optimism, John Frohnmayer journeyed to Washington, D.C., in 1989 to serve a cause he believed in deeply: the arts in America. Appointed by President Bush to be chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, he was abruptly fired two and a half years later in a storm of front-page controversy.Leaving Town Alive is Frohnmayer's lively and startlingly candid account of his trial by fire in the brutal world of power politics. Taking over the NEA amid the uproar about Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photographs, Frohnmayer stood at the center of the emotional debate over public funding for the arts. On the left were staunch defenders of free speech and the artists whose confrontational works came under attack. On the right were Jesse Helms and the fundamentalist proponents of traditional values.At first Frohnmayer assumed that he could negotiate anything and that everyone had the best interests of the country at heart. He was wrong: the White House, for instance, just wanted the problem of \"offensive art\" to go away, while right-wing fund-raisers wanted to keep the issue alive as long as possible. In the end, Frohnmayer's harrowing education changed him. He entered the fray a First Amendment moderate; he emerged a free-speech radical.John Frohnmayer had an insider's view of Washington during the Bush years, and he writes with remarkable frankness about the bitter battles over the government's involvement in the arts. Passionate, witty, and wonderfully readable, Leaving Town Alive is, finally, an eloquent plea for the liberation of American culture from the narrow concerns of partisan politics.",

    "Description": "It could be you or someone you love. Strong, silent types are everywhere, and it is their telltale silence that has kept their problems hidden until now. A silent son can come from a family that coped with violence, alcoholism, child abuse, extreme rigidity, or divorce, but all silent sons have certain common characteristics:   They keep things that bother them to themselves.  They deny that unpleasant events occur.  They fear letting people know them.  They have difficulty interacting with their parents, spouses, or children.  They have a strong fear of criticism.  They are often angry.   In Silent Sons, Dr. Robert Ackerman, a silent son himself, examines the problems that commonly confront silent sons, keeping them from experiencing the full range of human emotions. In a compassionate and hopeful voice, the author defines the silent son and examines the impact of parents, particularly fathers, on these men and shows how their dysfunctional upbringing affects their present relationships, especially with women.  By putting aside anger, finding peace with one's self, and looking for support from other silent sons, Dr. Ackerman feels every man can realize his full potential and become a well balanced, healthy survivor.",

    "Title": "What Went Wrong?: Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response",
    "Authors": "By Lewis, Bernard",
    "Description": "For many centuries, the world of Islam was in the forefront of human achievement--the foremost military and economic power in the world, the leader in the arts and sciences of civilization. Christian Europe, a remote land beyond its northwestern frontier, was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed, as the previously despised West won victory after victory, first in the battlefield and the marketplace, then in almost every aspect of public and even private life.    In this intriguing volume, Bernard Lewis examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to understand why things had changed--how they had been overtaken, overshadowed, and to an increasing extent dominated by the West. Lewis provides a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil. He shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry and military tactics, commerce and industry, government and diplomacy, education and culture. Lewis highlights the striking differences between the Western and Middle Eastern cultures from the 18th to the 20th centuries through thought-provoking comparisons of such things as Christianity and Islam, music and the arts, the position of women, secularism and the civil society, the clock and the calendar.   Hailed in The New York Times Book Review as \"the doyen of Middle Eastern studies,\" Bernard Lewis is one of the West's foremost authorities on Islamic history and culture. In this striking volume, he offers an incisive look at the historical relationship between the Middle East and Europe.",

Since its release in the United Kingdom, Brass has sent shock waves through literary circles for its raw, unrelenting, poetic, and utterly compelling portrait of Millie, a promising college kid drifting into a deceptively inviting world of street culture, drug-induced adorations, and sexual hedonism.Helen Walsh, at the age of twenty-seven, has produced a staggeringly alive debut novel that portrays a generation of youth?those coming of age in the '80s and '90s?through the prism of Millie. Millie and her best friend, Jamie, have been through it all together. However, as Millie is lured away from what was a promising academic career toward a life of numbing drugs and increasingly deviant sexual encounters, Jamie is finally settling down with his girlfriend. Millie feels betrayed by one of the few authentic and nurturing relationships in her life, just as she discovers her own limitations and the more penetrating complexities of a family she thought she knew.",

    "Description": "Alan Dershowitz, one of the foremost legal thinkers of our time, explores a series of questions raised by the most watched criminal trial in American history. Through this brilliant, bold, and eye-opening account of the O.J. Simpson case, he exposes the realities of the criminal justice system of this country.Widely recognized as America's leading appellate attorney and by any measure a great lawyer. Dershowitz was the man chosen to prepare the appeal if Simpson had been convicted. Now Professor Dershowitz steps back from that role, not to defend the defense team, nor even to plead the case for his client's innocence. Instead, he uses the case to examine the larger issues and to identify the social forces - media, money, gender, and race - that shape the criminal justice system in America today.",

    "Title": "The Lives of the Muses: Nine Women & the Artists They Inspired",
    "Authors": "By Prose, Francine",
    "Description": "In a brilliant, wry, and provocative new book, National Book Award finalist Francine Prose explores the complex relationship between the artist and his muse. In so doing, she illuminates with great sensitivity and intelligence the elusive emotional wellsprings of the creative process.There is no ideal muse, but rather as many variations on the theme as there are individual women who have had the luck, or misfortune, to find their destiny conjoined with that of a particular artist. What are we to make of the relationship between the child Alice Liddell, who inspired Alice in Wonderland, and the Oxford don who became Lewis Carroll? Or the so-called serial muse, Lou Andreas-Salomé, who captivated Nietzsche, Rilke, and Freud—as impressive a list as any muse can boast? Salvador Dalí was the only artist to sign his art with his muse's name, and Gala Dalí certainly knew how to market her artist and his work while simultaneously burnishing her own image and celebrity.Lou, Gala, and Yoko Ono all defy the feminist stereotype of the muse as a passive beauty put on a pedestal and oppressed by a male artist. However, it's rare to find an artist and muse who are genuine partners, true collaborators, such as ballerina Suzanne Farrell and choreographer George Balanchine.What do the nine muses chosen by Francine Prose have in common? They were all beautiful, or sexy, or gifted with some more unconventional appeal. All loved, and were loved by, their artists, and inspired them with an intensity of emotion akin to Eros. For these artists, the love of—or for—their muses provided an essential element required for the melding of talent and technique necessary to create art.",

    "Authors": "By Dallek, Robert",
    "Description": "With American foreign policy playing an increasingly dominant role in world events of the past century, the international diplomatic community and even Americans themselves have staged heated debates centering on the charge that our government often misreads international crises.      Responding to the controversy, Robert Dallek's groundbreaking book argues that the pressures generated by unresolved political and social domestic problems have shaped American foreign policy. In an illuminating examination of each significant period--from the expansionism of the Spanish-American War and the American entrance into World War I, to American-Soviet relations during World War II, the Cold War period that followed, and American involvement in Korea and Vietnam--Dallek reveals why we have acted as we have, often in the face of logic and with costly consequences.       Providing a wealth of new insights, he presents American foreign policies in the twentieth century as symbolic extensions of domestic hopes and fears.  Reaching beyond traditional explanations of why and how these policies reflect U.S. concerns at home more than realities abroad, this important and provocative analysis challenges thinking Americans to confront the whole fascinating history of American foreign affairs in the twentieth century.",

Theirs was a mismatch made in heaven, a marriage with infidelities on both sides, verbal taunts and physical abuse, separations, and the strains of Lawrence's long struggle with tuberculosis. Yet her determined influence on his life and work cannot be overestimated, and they remained together until his bitter, tragic death.",

    "Description": "In Ashes of Glory, Ernest B. Furgurson conjures up wartime Richmond in vivid detail. We meet not only with such luminaries as Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Stonewall Jackson but with a strikingly broad spectrum of the community: preachers, nurses, newspapermen, bureaucrats, entrepreneurs, slaves, slave dealers, bootleggers, actors, spies, prostitutes, prisoners of war, refugees, handsome widows, eager debutantes, and swarms of enlisted men and officers from all over the South.Furgurson ushers us into the legendary Spotswood Hotel, where generals and gentry communed amid gossip and bourbon. He admits us to the hospitals crammed with amputees and infested by rats. He plunges us into a bread riot involving several hundred citizens and spurred by a \"woman huckster.\" He shows us that, despite universal hardship, Richmond fairly crackled with spirit: theater manager John Hill Hewitt kept melodrama flowing on the city's popular stages; taffy parties, faro parlors, and sewing circles kept various other constituencies entertained; Colonel Thomas E. Rose of Pennsylvania and dozens more tunneled out of notorious Libby Prison; the genteel Union sympathizer Elizabeth Van Lew conducted an elaborate and extraordinarily successful campaign of espionage. Meanwhile, beneath the surface, a compound of defiance, despair, and paranoia preyed on the nerves of everyone from President Davis on down, turning a stunned and battered, once-glamorous society virtually inside out.",

It is soon after the Civil War; Aimee lives alone, but is graced with visits from two friends, a crippled man and a troubled eleven-year-old girl. She is perpetually caught between the sensual world she so desires and the divine retribution passed down to her by her mother's scorn.

Here are the last two weeks of Stella's senior year in Orange County, California: the intensive AP final exams; the childish, celebratory trips; the totemic importance attached to graduation. Beneath Stella's mordantly funny take on her life is the decisiveness with which she disengages from it, planting clues and providing explanations for those who will try to understand the act she is about to commit.

Now, in his most moving and accessible novel yet, he gives us the story of the greatest and most universal tragedy, the loss of that childhood world. At twelve, Aron Kleinfeld is the ringleader among the boys in his Jerusalem neighborhood, their inspiration in dreaming up games and adventures. But as his friends begin to mature, Aron remains imprisoned for three long years in the body of a child. While Israel inches toward the Six-Day War, and while the voices of his friends change and become strange to him, Aron lives in his child body as though in a nightmare. Like a spy in enemy territory, he learns to decipher the internal codes of sexuality and desire, to understand the unyielding bureaucracy of the human body. Hurled between childhood and adulthood, between the pure and the profane, he is like a volcano of emotions and impulses. But, like his hero Houdini, Aron still struggles to escape from the trap of growing up.The Book of Intimate Grammar is about the alchemy of childhood, which transforms loneliness and fear into creation, and about the struggle to emerge as an artist. Funny, painful and passionate, it is a work of enormous intensity and beauty.",

In this illuminating investigation of the epidemic of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) today and its most widely prescribed treatment, the powerful psychostimulant Ritalin, psychologist Richard DeGrandpre sounds a warning: we may well be failing our children by treating symptoms and not causes with a quick-fix and ultimately unsatisfactory solution. Drawing on the latest findings from developmental, psychobiological, and social scientific research, DeGrandpre seeks to solve the problem of ADD by \"solving\" its history. He attributes the disturbing prevalence of inattention and hyperactivity in children to the larger societal consequences of a speed-up culture that has profoundly altered our perceptual expectations, our very experience of time, and our ability to defer gratification. Our society-wide rush to more, and faster, stimulation leaves children especially vulnerable to \"sensory addictions.\" Ritalin Nation both exposes the shortsightedness of mere biological explanations of ADD and offers some practical guidelines for charting a more hopeful future in environments that deliberately \"make time for time,\" cultivate a less hurried existence, and promote a saner, safer community for our children.",

    "Authors": "By Kluger, Richard",
    "Description": "No book before this one has rendered the story of cigarettes -- mankind's most common self-destructive instrument and its most profitable consumer product -- with such sweep and enlivening detail.Here for the first time, in a story full of the complexities and contradictions of human nature, all the strands of the historical process -- financial, social, psychological, medical, political, and legal -- are woven together in a riveting narrative. The key characters are the top corporate executives, public health investigators, and antismoking activists who have clashed ever more stridently as Americans debate whether smoking should be closely regulated as a major health menace.We see tobacco spread rapidly from its aboriginal sources in the New World 500 years ago, as it becomes increasingly viewed by some as sinful and some as alluring, and by government as a windfall source of tax revenue. With the arrival of the cigarette in the late-nineteenth century, smoking changes from a luxury and occasional pastime to an everyday -- to some, indispensable -- habit, aided markedly by the exuberance of the tobacco huskers.This free-enterprise success saga grows shadowed, from the middle of this century, as science begins to understand the cigarette's toxicity. Ironically the more detailed and persuasive the findings by medical investigators, the more cigarette makers prosper by seeming to modify their product with filters and reduced dosages of tar and nicotine.We see the tobacco manufacturers come under intensifying assault as a rogue industry for knowingly and callously plying their hazardous wares while insisting that the health charges against them (a) remain unproven, and (b) are universally understood, so smokers indulge at their own risk.Among the eye-opening disclosures here: outrageous pseudo-scientific claims made for cigarettes throughout the '30s and '40s, and the story of how the tobacco industry and the National Cancer Institute spent millions to develop a \"safer",

    "Title": "Ronald Reagan: His Life In Pictures",
    "Authors": "By Spada, James",
    "Description": "An extraordinary life story in more than 340 photographs, most never before published.Ronald Wilson Reagan lived the American Dream-- over and over again. During his long, astonishing life, he has succeeded at everything he attempted. College football letterman. Heroic lifeguard. Sports announcer. Movie star. Television host. Corporate spokesman. Governor. And finally, the greatest dream of all: President of the United States.Fully two-thirds of the images in this book have never been published before, and they offer us glimpses into the private man as well as the public icon. We see him as a little boy in his mother's Sunday-school class; welcoming home GIs with Bette Davis; helping his daughter prepare for a ballet recital, and celebrating the birth of his namesake with his wife Nancy. In a wonderful assortment of unseen images from his presidential library, we see every aspect of the President, from building a snowman with his grandson on the White House lawn to anguishing over the deaths of Marines in Beirut.No matter what one's politics, these images, and James Spada's evocative, balanced text, provide new insights into a man whose life embodies the promise of America.",

    "Title": "Deadlock: The Inside Story of America's Closest Election",
    "Authors": "By Nakashima, Ellen",
    "Description": "When Americans cast their ballots on November 7, 2000, no one expected that the outcome of the presidential election would still be in doubt more than a month later. For the first time ever, the race for America's highest office had ended in a dead heat, with but a few hundred votes in Florida separating Vice President Al Gore and Governor George W. Bush of Texas. The stage was set for an extraordinary drama of recounts, challenges, court cases - and hanging, swinging, and dimpled chads.Deadlock is the first comprehensive account of what really happened in the \"post-election\" of 2000, written and reported by the award-winning political staff of The Washington Post, America's premier newspaper for politics and elections. Drawing on hundreds of interviews with the key participants and offering details never before reported by any news organization, the Post staff has produced not just an original work of history-in-the-making, but a page-turner to rival the best political thrillers.",

    "Title": "Truman",
    "Authors": "By McCullough, David",
    "Description": "The Pulitzer Prize–winning biography of Harry S. Truman, whose presidency included momentous events from the atomic bombing of Japan to the outbreak of the Cold War and the Korean War, told by America’s beloved and distinguished historian.The life of Harry S. Truman is one of the greatest of American stories, filled with vivid characters—Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Wallace Truman, George Marshall, Joe McCarthy, and Dean Acheson—and dramatic events. In this riveting biography, acclaimed historian David McCullough not only captures the man—a more complex, informed, and determined man than ever before imagined—but also the turbulent times in which he rose, boldly, to meet unprecedented challenges. The last president to serve as a living link between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, Truman’s story spans the raw world of the Missouri frontier, World War I, the powerful Pendergast machine of Kansas City, the legendary Whistle-Stop Campaign of 1948, and the decisions to drop the atomic bomb, confront Stalin at Potsdam, send troops to Korea, and fire General MacArthur. Drawing on newly discovered archival material and extensive interviews with Truman’s own family, friends, and Washington colleagues, McCullough tells the deeply moving story of the seemingly ordinary “man from Missouri” who was perhaps the most courageous president in our history.",

    "Title": "Alistair Cooke's America",
    "Authors": "By Cooke, Alistair",
    "Description": "Classics stand the test of time, and Alistair Cooke’s history of America is a classic. Nearly three decades have passed since the original edition of America?based on journalist-historian Cooke’s extraordinarily popular thirteen-part television series?sold more than a million copies. Yet Cooke’s view of America’s dynamic past and its impact upon the always-changing present continues to provide striking insights into the singular character of a nation. Those thirty years since award-winning America first rose to the top of best-seller lists have themselves wrought further dramatic changes. Presidents have been impeached, economies have toppled, empires have collapsed, and towers have fallen. In light of such events, Cooke has written for this new edition a compelling introduction and final chapter that bring his story of America up to date with the wisdom of the inimitably grand old man of correspondents. And what a story this book tells. From the discovery of America by European explorers to modern times; from the fighters for independence to the pioneers who tamed the West; from the slaves who fled to freedom to the huddled masses that sought a new life in the New World. And through it all, Cooke describes the essential forces that make America work so vitally. Updated in light of the September 11th tragedy, this new edition is complimented with full-color illustrations throughout. ?The first and maybe the finest, tribute to the nation.”?Newsweek ?A panoramic book, traveling fast and high, and the view it gives of our land and its people is exhilarating.”?Atlantic Monthly",

    "Title": "Improvised Europeans: American Literary Expatriates In London",
    "Authors": "By Zwerdling, Alex",
    "Description": "At the turn of the century the United States seemed poised to overtake its European rivals on all fronts; its many strengths were finally being recognized—the wealth of resources, the profusion of ideas and innovation, and the artistic talent of its citizens. American power was expanding and American writers—including Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Whitman—were acclaimed at home and abroad. England’s condescending air toward America had already become inappropriate. The United States had reached a new level of respectability in the world. In light of this favorable international climate, why then did some of America’s most talented young writers travel to London to become, as Henry Adams put it, ”improvised Europeans”?Few writers have been studied and analyzed as much as the quartet at the heart of this book. But Alex Zwerdling was perplexed by this shared and often overlooked aspect of their background: Why, at the dawn of the American century, did these writers choose to go ”back” to what was called ”the Old World”? And why would these brilliant thinkers include in some of their most acclaimed work material that is today reviled as offensive—anti-Semetic, racist, anti-feminist? What was happening in the United States that repelled them? In striving to answer these questions, Alex Zwerdling illuminates the lives and careers of Henry Adams, Henry James, T.S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound as never before.These men chose to live their lives abroad at a crucial point in American history, both domestically and internationally. The massive influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe began to whittle away the Anglo-Saxon majority. The end of slavery created a renewal of efforts to make true the Constitution’s claim to universal equality. Women’s confidence and authority grew as they fought for independence and their own rights. These developments, Zwerdling argues, were large factors in why these four writers fled. He examines their works a",
